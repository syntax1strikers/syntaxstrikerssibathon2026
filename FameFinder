FameFinder is an interactive guessing game inspired by the concept used in games such as Akinator, but uniquely designed to focus on Pakistani celebrities.
In this game, the user thinks of a famous Pakistani personality while the system attempts to guess the correct person by asking a series of intelligent and well-structured questions
based on attributes such as gender, profession, era of fame, and popularity. A structured database of Pakistani celebrities, including well-known figures such as Atif Aslam, Mahira Khan, and Babar Azam,
will be used to store this information and allow the system to narrow down possible options after each user response. The project will be developed using C++ as the core programming language along with
a graphical user interface to provide a smooth and engaging gaming experience, including interactive question screens and a final reveal of the guessed celebrity.
By combining gaming mechanics, intelligent decision-making logic, and Pakistani cultural representation, PakStar Guess aims to deliver a fun, innovative, and meaningful hackathon project.
